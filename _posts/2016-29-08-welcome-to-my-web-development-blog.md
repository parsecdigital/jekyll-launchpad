Hello, I’m Dave Berning, a web developer and designer from Cincinnati, Ohio. Starting today, I will begin to post my thoughts and updates for you to read. This blog will be a tool for me to provide updates on projects, thoughts, and snippets to help everyone (including myself) stay informed with the web. I plan on writing at least twice a month, if not weekly so please subscribe to my RSS feed to get the latest updates!

Any website and blog feedback would be great. Also, if you are interested in starting a new project with me or guest blogging, please [contact me](http://daveberning.io/connect/).

Don’t forget to follow me on the “InterWebs” @daveberning.
