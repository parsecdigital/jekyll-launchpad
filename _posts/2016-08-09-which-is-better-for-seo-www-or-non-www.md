I know this may be a touchy subject but, I'd like to give my two cents on the WWW vs non-WWW debate. I feel like this is another classic example of the infamous "tabs vs spaces" argument (by the way: spaces > tabs).

Anyway, I'll keep this short as it's been covered before many times before.

## What's The Big Deal?
The big deal is your SEO and page rank. In today's world, SEO is everything. It's how you separate yourself from the others on the Web, increase your revenue and increase your exposure. If you sell products online for example, you want your SEO to be top notch. A higher page rank means more sales and more money.

Any little bit of SEO goes a long way. So it's important to evaluate every little thing can be done to increase your rank. One of these things that developers consider is whether or not to stick with WWW. I worked at a digital marketing agency in Cincinnati and every website was prefixed with the WWW.

I've heard this before from developers, "Why would you negatively affect your SEO efforts just for domain aesthetics?" My answer to that is, "uh, I'm not."

## WWW is Not Better Than Non-WWW
WWW is not better than non-WWW, they're equal. Google does not care one bit which version you choose; just make sure you're consistent! Google treats www.daveberning.io and daveberning.io as two separate websites and will rank whichever one higher based on visits and other factors. That's why it's important to pick one and stay with it. If you pick the non-WWW, make sure that every link to your website and every page is non-WWW. It's also important to make sure that all your traffic from the WWW gets redirected to your non-WWW.

## Still Not Convinced?
If you're still worried about which one to use, look at some notable companies and see which type of URL they use.

Websites with WWW

+ [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)
+ [Apple](http://www.apple.com/)
+ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

Websites without WWW

+ [GitHub](https://github.com/)
+ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
+ [CodePen](http://codepen.io/)

If you need written proof, [check out this article from Matt Cutts himself](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-advice-url-canonicalization/). Granted, it is from 2006 but still relevant to the topic.

## TLDR
In the end, it doesn't matter which version you use. Google will not favor one URL over the other, just make sure you stick with one. Regardless of your position on this matter, I hope we can at least agree that www and non-www combined is just awful. Don't do that...and don't combine spaces and tabs either.
